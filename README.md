iCubArtwork
=========

This repository has been created in order to collect all of my design related work I've made for the iCub project. Inside there are two folders:


- **iCub-Icon** is the icon used in a variety of different places, such as the Codyco project [http://codyco.org/ or https://github.com/robotology/codyco ] or the iCub Wiki [ http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Main_Page ]
- **iCubGui-Icons** is the folder that collects the icons I developed for the iCubGui
- **VVVTshirt** is the t-shirt I made for VVV 14.
- **YARPLogo** is the folder in which there are the new YARP logo designs
